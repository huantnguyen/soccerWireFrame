                Now you have earn your team a free kick! The spot is a little bit outside of the penalty box to the left of the goal. While discussing options with your teammates, you notice that goalkeeper is standing more towards the right side of the goal and the players wall has some noticeable whole in between. So, what is your choice this time?

                <span>
                  Hah! Let's beat the keeper at his own mind game by kicking the ball with so much power to the upper right corner of course.

                <span>
                  Dang! He might be tricking me not to kick to the left so maybe a shot to the upper left corner would get him.

                <span>
                  Man his mind game is making me pretty nervous. Perhaps I will choose a safe option and put the ball in the middle of the goal.
                </span> <br> <br>

                <span>
                  I have a trick up my sleeve too! I will make a ridiculously slow run towards the ball that makes him become nervous and impatient. Then, I will kick the ball softly to the lower corner or either the right or left.
